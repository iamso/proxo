# Proxo

A (very simple) proxy server.


## Installation

### As package
```bash
npm install proxo
```

### As command line tool
```bash
npm install -g proxo
```

## Usage

### As package
```javascript
var proxo = require('proxo');
proxo(host, port, callback);
```
This starts the proxy server for the specified host from the specified port, calling the specified callback after initiliasing.

#### proxo(host, port, callback)

Only the host must be passed to the constructor. The other parameters are optional, but they have to be passed in the right order, meaning that if you want to pass a callback, you have to pass a port (or NULL).

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| host | The host to send the request to. |
| port ***(optional)*** | The port to listen on the proxy server. |
| callback ***(optional)*** | The callback to call after initialising. |


### As command line tool
```bash
proxo -h some-vhost.local -p 1234
#Â or
proxo some-vhost.local 1234
```
This starts the proxy server for the specified host from the specified port.

The arguments are optional. If you don't pass a host, the host will be `localhost` and if you don't pass a port, the port will be a random free port.

If you're not using named arguments, the order is important: first the host, then the port.

If you're using named arguments, use the following in any order:

| Argument Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-h` | The host to send the request to. |
| `-p` | The port to listen on the proxy server. |
